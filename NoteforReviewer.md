Only recommendation I have not followed is to delete third argument in function addNewCard()

I understand the recommendation, but on my card array I have made custom ALT texts- and I would hate to loose them / overwrite with a meaningless "image of" + placename

I hope this is ok.

Thank you for your reviews. I always enjoy them and learn from them.
