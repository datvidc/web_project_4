# project 8: around the US.

Project is focusing on the introduction of Webpack/babel along with other node_modules needed for deploying backwards compatible code.

Rest of the project is now refactored into classes with correct folder and component structure.

    Note: mixed use of single quotes and double quotes. Recently got my first American keyboard which prompts the use of single quotes over double quotes.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Have fun with JavaScript!
