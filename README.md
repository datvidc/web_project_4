### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Have fun with JavaScript!
